# stock-predictor-with-LSTM
This is my version of a LSTM based stock closing price predicting model. Streamlit was used to export the model into a web app. The web app allows users to visualize the predictions based on hitorical data.
This version runs on python 3.11.7 and due to various deprications of liberaries, it has been tested to run on the latest patches of general use libraries as tested on Jan 2024.
Further updates to be made include :
 - adding precise prediction zone
 - quantify errors accross various predictions.
